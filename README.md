# SQL to NoSQL Conversion Tool (Back-End)

This Sql to NoSQL Conversion Tool Node.js & Express.js server code for the 2023 Project (6G6Z1101_2223_9Z6). I have used the MDN Web Docs general, as well JS-specific, code styling guidelines.

## Running The App

1. Extract the zip file on your local machine.
   
2. In the terminal, run the server with `npm start`.
   

## Side Notes
The efficiency of this tool will be heavily influenced by the hardware specifications of the device it runs on. I have tested this tool on a computer with Ryzen 5 5600X @ 3.70 GHz and 32GB of 3600 MHz RAM. With those specs, the tool's conversion speed is ~5,600 records per second. A device with lower specs may convert less records per second and vice versa.
